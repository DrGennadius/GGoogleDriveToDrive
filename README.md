# GGoogleDriveToDrive

A simple example of a program to download and export files from Google Drive.

# Attention!

To use authorization for the **Google Drive API**, client secrets embedded in the code are used as standard. You can try to use this data or use your own. Alternatively, you can put the file "client_secrets.json" in the directory with the executable file. This data can be taken from Google Cloud Platform (https://console.cloud.google.com/), using OAuth 2.0 Client ID. You can also see an example of this file: [client_secrets.example.json](https://github.com/DrGennadius/GGoogleDriveToDrive/blob/master/GGoogleDriveToDrive/client_secrets.example.json).
